# JS Password Generator

Our third assignment was to build a functional password generator from existing code using HTML, CSS, and a bit of existing Javascript. I had to code out the rest of the Javascript using what we've learned in JS, including: global and local variables, arrays, functions, objects, and conditional statements to code a working password generator within the JS file.
